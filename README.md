# Flask App Deployment with Docker, Kubernetes & Terraform

This project demonstrates a local DevOps infrastructure using **Docker**, **Kubernetes (Minikube)**, and **Terraform** to deploy a simple Flask web application. It showcases containerization, declarative infrastructure, and infrastructure-as-code in a beginner-friendly and real-world-ready setup.

## 🚀 How to Run This Project

### 1. Build & Tag Docker Image
```bash
eval $(minikube -p minikube docker-env)   # Only needed on Minikube
docker build -t flask-k8s-app:v1 .
2. Deploy Using Kubernetes YAML
bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
🧠 The app will run on:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:30007
3. Alternatively, Deploy Using Terraform
bash
Copy code
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
Note: Make sure the Kubernetes provider is configured correctly and Minikube is running.

🎯 Objective
To simulate a production-like CI/CD pipeline locally using:

Docker for containerization

Kubernetes for orchestration

Terraform for automated infrastructure deployment

This gives you hands-on exposure to how Cloud Engineers work in modern DevOps environments.

📹 Demo

✅ Highlights
⚙️ Infrastructure-as-Code with Terraform

☸️ Local Kubernetes using Minikube

🐳 Dockerized Flask App

📄 Clean YAML definitions & reusable IaC
