# Flask App Deployment with Docker, Kubernetes & Terraform

This project demonstrates a local DevOps infrastructure using **Docker**, **Kubernetes (Minikube)**, and **Terraform** to deploy a simple Flask web application. It simulates production-like CI/CD with real-world tools in a beginner-friendly setup.

## 🚀 How to Run This Project

### 1. Build & Tag the Docker Image

```bash
eval $(minikube -p minikube docker-env)
docker build -t flask-k8s-app:v1 .
````

---

### 2. Deploy Using Kubernetes YAML

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
```

🧠 Access the app on:

```
http://localhost:30007
```

---

### 3. Alternatively, Deploy Using Terraform

```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
```

✅ Make sure:

* Minikube is running
* K8s provider is configured properly in Terraform

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To simulate a **real-world DevOps workflow** with:

* 🐳 Docker for containerization
* ☸️ Kubernetes for orchestration
* 📦 Terraform for infrastructure as code

This teaches how Cloud Engineers manage local CI/CD-like setups.

## 🙈 .gitignore Summary

```
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.backup
.terraform/
.terraform.lock.hcl
```

👉 Keeps Terraform state, backups, and cache out of Git commits.
